Firstly we need to know that data is stored in digital form of series of 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs
<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/2.png" alt="image2">

But it must be understandable by humans so it must be organized within a organization system.

We can think of organizing files, like how books are organized in the library.

A system similar to the ones used at libraries is what we call in the computer‚Äôs world a ‚Äú**file system‚Äù;** This means we could think of a file system, as the **method used** to **track files** on a disk or partition.

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/3.png" alt="image3">

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/4.png" alt="image4">

When we acquire a forensic image, we usually do at the device layer; this means that it will contain files and whatever inside them along with the file system‚Äôs metadata itself.

Analyzing file systems is one of the most important task a digital forensics investigator must be capable of doing.

To analyze file system, we must need to understand how file systems work, and know how to interpret those blocks of 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs into file system metadata. These metadata could help lead to the actual data found in files required for the investigation. 

Also the deleted data too. ü§î

Question is :**How can we acquire deleted data ?**

Truth is, when we delete a file, the pointer that is pointing or tracking that file is removed and no longer there.

Another question is: **What about the data?**

And yes it will stay there. It will stay as long as the location where it is stored has not been used again by another file.

It‚Äôs not easy to perform analysis during such situation. We face couple of challenges:

1. First we need to understand how the data is stored on disk (We done in previous module)
2. Secondly, we need to understand how to interpret such data into useful file system information and/or files.

    a. Directories are actually a specific type of file (to be continued in upcoming slides)

    b. And to do that, we first need to understand how file systems organize files on storage media.

And all those files and directories we see are actually just an arbitrarily sequence of bytes (0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs) that are stored within some media (eg: disks)

Also we read in previous module that disks are capable of reading and writing using blocks of **sectors. By d way, sectors have fixed size.**

Now the question is: **Then how can we know that which sequence of bytes belong to which sectors and which sectors, belong to which file?**

Hence, we need a **map** or something like that.

And this lead to another query; **whether files will actually reserve contiguous sectors or could files actually reserve and allocate any free (unallocated) sector they want?**

And understand (Free means the sector is unallocated and unfree means the sector is allocated)

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/5.png" alt="image5">

The allocation idea actually means: we need a map and an algorithm or technique to select the free sectors found on the disk and allocate them on files.

The allocation algorithm or technique for file system will vary with other as they choose based on what they find better.

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/6.png" alt="image6">

**We need a mechanism to achieve this** and this is where file names jumps in.

At last, We basically need the following:

1. Names to label files
2. A map capable of tracking:
    - Names to files
    - Files to sectors
    - Sectors to the 0s and 1s on storage media (eg: disks)

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/7.png" alt="image7">


### <ins>FAT File System Analysis:</ins>

FAT (File Allocation Table) is a very simple, yet robust computer file system. It was originally designed to be used by floppy disks in 1977. FAT is one of the oldest file systems used by Microsoft with their **MS-DOS** operating system.

FAT uses simple index table to track files on disks, that‚Äôs why it is called File Allocation Table.

It has not been disappeared; it is still the default file system used today by USB thumb drive and Memory Card used with Cameras.

We will also find it used on EFI booting partitions.

***Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, it's purpose is to store all data about device initialization and startup in a .efi file, which is kept on special disk partition called EFI System Partition (ESP). ESP also holds the bootloader responsible for booting the operating system.*** 

**(GPT partition used UEFI partition)**

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/8.png" alt="image8">

FAT file system has different types:

1. FAT12
2. FAT16
3. FAT32
4. Extended File Allocation Table (ExFAT)

(FAT12, FAT16, FAT32) ‚Üí For this course

**What about those numbers in FAT system (12, 16,32)?**

`These refers to number of bits used for clusters addressing. That means a 12-bit FAT can have a cluster size of 2^12 (different numbers, Ex: compare with hex as hex contain 2^16 diff numbers) [Higher the number (bits), higher will be the size. For ex, if 3-bits, it will have 8 (2^3) different numbers as; 000, 001, 010, 011, 100,101,111;  Also , size = 8 bits =  1bytes)`

***Similarly, for 12-bit FAT; It will have 2^12 different numbers or 2^12 bits size = 4096 bits ‚áí 512 bytes (4096/8)***

**Again our question rise as, What actually is cluster here?**

A cluster, is the smallest logical unit a file system can allocate to a file. The cluster size is defined at the time you initialize the partition or volume; That means, it is defined when we format the partition.

A cluster can be anything from **512 bytes,** up to the limit of the file system used.

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/9.png" alt="image9">

The reason for cluster being the minimal size of 512-bytes is , the minimum size of sector is 512-bytes.

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/10.png" alt="image10">

The number of sectors per cluster is defined when we format the disk and it is determined by default based on the size of disk or partition used.

This number is defined within the **Boot Record** of the file system.

`Formatting the disk is a way of preparing the disk to hold data on it. The format initializes the file system and the data structures required to track files on the disk.`

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/11.png" alt="image11">

Whenever a file is created, the file system must allocate a number of clusters to it. This is where the number of sectors per cluster is important because the cluster‚Äôs size has an impact on both the performance and utilization of disk

**Using a big cluster might lead to waste in disk capacity and using a small cluster could lead to an overhead**

*[Also we need to understand that when we say a cluster could represent a number of sectors, this means they are contiguous. That means; these sectors follows each other, they are one after the other]*

For example: if we have **4** sectors for a cluster, then whenever we create a file, it will be allocated **four** contiguously allocated sectors. This helps file systems access data easily.

The main reason is: The access speed for a file will be faster. For Example: *if we have a Hard Disk drive, then disk will not need to move up and down for the platters and heads. It only needs to know where the first sector for the file resides and the slide through the sector for that file.*

**[Note: If the file is too large to fit within a track or platter, then the head will have to move to that location for accessing such file.]**

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/12.png" alt="image12">

In this example it is assumed that there were no files previously created on the disk and we created file1 and file2 after each other. Understand that we will not always see in such way. It‚Äôs just an ex:
<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/13.png" alt="image13">

Now check for file2, which has 1024 bytes. We will find only two sectors were used, while other two were allocated to the file but not used.

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/14.png" alt="image14">

Here we need to understand that, at **High-Level** view of the disk, we found that first four sectors were allocated to file1 and the next four sectors were for file2, but when we checked a **Low-level** view of the content for each cluster, we found that file1 had a whole cluster allocated but used only one sector of the cluster, while file2 had used only half the sectors of the cluster. 

`It means, file1 wasted three sectors while file2 wasted only two.`

### <ins> Structures: </ins>

Let‚Äôs view the structures of the FAT file system. The figure below shows the high-level view of the FAT file system structure within the disk.

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/17.png" alt="image17">

1. **Reserved Area:**
    
    The size of **sectors** within the **Reserved Area** depends on the type of FAT file system used:
    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/18.png" alt="image18">

2. **FAT Area:**

    FAT Area for FAT32  file system has two parts whereas for FAT12 and FAT16 have one one.
    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/19.png" alt="image19">

    As the Reserved Area depends on the FAT used, let‚Äôs check for the FAT12/16 file system.

    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/20.png" alt="image20">

    As for the FAT32 file system, the structure is :
    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/21.png" alt="image21">

    Let‚Äôs view the boot sector of FAT32 volume using Disk Editor:
    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/22.png" alt="image22">

    When we check for the 32 sectors allocated:
    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/23.png" alt="image23">

    From the above diagram we can assume that:

    ‚Üí Sector 0 and 6 are used for the **Volume Boot Sector**

    ‚Üí Sectors 1 and 7 are used for the **File System Information (FSINFO)** structure.

    ‚Üí Sectors 2 and 8 are used for the **Bootstrap Code.**

    `Boot strap sectors will be empty if the volume is non-bootable, but it still end with a signature (0x55AA).`

    <ins>Boot Sector:</ins>

    Let‚Äôs first view the boot sector for FAT12/16:
    
    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/24.png" alt="image24">

    **Note**: The size of BIOS Parameter Block (BPB), Extended BIOS Parameter Block (EBPB) and the Bootstrap code varies based on the operating system and versions.

    The boot sector for the FAT32 file system:

    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/25.png" alt="image25">
    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/26.png" alt="image26">

    ‚Üí **OEM** - Original Equipment Manufacturer (It is used for system recovery or factory restore. It allows users to easily and quickly restore the system to original state when system failure or system crash occurs.)

    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/27.png" alt="image27">

    ‚Üí **BIOS Parameter Block** - It is a data structure in Volume Boot Record (VBR) describing the physical layout of data storage volume. On partitioned devices, such as Hard Disks, it describes the volume partition and for unpartitioned devices (like Floppy Disks, it describes entire medium)

    Byte Level dissection of the Boot Sector of a FAT32 file system.

    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/28.png" alt="image28">


    ‚Üí **Jump Boot Code** holds the command used to jump to the boot code.

    ‚Üí In the above example it shows, EB 58 90

    ‚Üí EB 58 is the byte code for the assemble instruction jmp 005A.

    ‚Üí 90 is the byte code for the assemble instruction NOP **{**mnemonic for NO Operation**}**

    ‚Üí **OEM Name/Version** could hold the type of system the disk was formatted for, or the utility used or even a serial no. In above example; it holds MSDOS5.0 (From ASCII table)

    <ins>BIOS Parameter Block (BPB):</ins>

    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/29.png" alt="image28">

    1. Bytes Per Sector: We here have a value of 0002 that equals to 512 bytes/sector
    2. Sectors per Cluster: We here have two sectors per cluster, based on the value found (From Fig). It means (512+512 bytes of 1 cluster)
    3. Reserved No of sectors: Holds the number of reserved sectors. It is variable in a FAT32 file system. From above fig: we see that the value of FE19 equals 6654 sectors.
        
        ‚Üí **How is this calculation done?**

        `So first the value we obtained within the Disk Editor is converted to little-endian method, which means FE19‚Üí 19FE, Now convert into decimal we get: 6654 sectors`
    4. No. of FATs: holds number of FAT tables. From above fig, it holds the value of 02 which means we have 2 FAT Tables.
    5. Number of root directory Entries: holds the number of directory entries, it will be zero for FAT32. From above fig: it shows: 0000
    6. Total number of sectors in filesystem:  holds the total number of sectors in file system. It will be zero for FAT32. From above fig: it shows 0000
    7. Media Type: Holds the media descriptor, which would be **f0 for floppy** and **f8 for Hard disk**. Within our example: we found **f8.**
    8. No. of sectors per FAT: Holds the number of sectors for each FAT. It is zero for FAT32 and within above example: we found 0000
    9. No of sectors per track: It contain 2 bytes with no. of sectors per track. In above fig: we found 3F00, which means 63 sectors/track.
    10. Number of Heads: These 2 bytes holds the no. of heads in the drive. We found 4000 which means we have 64 heads.
    11. Number of hidden sectors: 4 bytes holding the no. of sectors preceding the partition. Here we found 800000, which means we have 128 sectors.
    12. Total number of sectors in filesystem: 4 bytes holding the total number of sectors in the file system. The no found was 00200300 which means we have 204800 sectors. And, we can say this partition  is 104857600 bytes or 102400 Megabytes (~100MB)
    13. Sectors per FAT: 4 bytes holding the number of sectors in each FAT. We found 01030000 which means we have 769 sectors per FAT.
    14. Extended Flags: 2 bytes holding the no of active FAT. In our example we have zero, which means:

        **‚Üí** Bits 0-3 : no of active FAT(if bit 7 is 1)

        **‚Üí** Bits 4-6 : reserved

        **‚Üí** Bits 7 : One means we have a single active FAT, zero all FATs are updated at runtime

        **‚Üí** Bits 8-15: Reserved
    15. Filesystem Version: 2 bytes holding FAT file system version. We found 0000
    16. First cluster of root directory: 4 bytes holding the cluster number of the first cluster in the root directory. This is usually two, and in our example, we found 0200000000 which is two.
    17. File System info Sector: 2 bytes holding the filesystem information sector number in FAT32 reserved area, which is usually 1. In our example, it was 0x0100, meaning it‚Äôs one.
    18. Backup boot sector location: 2 bytes holding the backup boot sector location. The value found would be either 0 or 0xffff if no backup used, but it is usually 6. We found 0x0600, meaning the backup is found at sector no six.
    19. Reserved: 12 bytes that are simply just reserved. They will be all zeros, and we truly found 0x000000000000000000000000 that in our example.


    <ins>Extended BIOS Parameter Block (EBPB):</ins>

    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/30.png" alt="image29">

    ‚Üí `Phys Disk No`: 1 byte holding the physical drive no used by the INT 13. We found 0x80, meaning 128.

    ‚Üí `Not used`: 1 byte reserved and not used. We found 0x00

    ‚Üí `Signature`: 1 byte indicating there are three other sections to follow. We found 0x29, which means 41

    ‚Üí `Volume Serial Number (ID)`: 4 byte holding the serial no. of the partition/volume. We found 0x9B2CF1EC

    ‚Üí `Volume Label`: 11 bytes holding the volume label. We found0x4E4F204E414D4520202020, which means we found the label ‚ÄúNO NAME‚Äù

    ‚Üí `File System ID`: 8 bytes, holding the file system type. Here we found FAT32.

    <ins>FSINFO Sector:</ins>

    The sections of FSINFO (File System Information) as:

    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/31.png" alt="image31">

    Exploring the FAT32 FSINFO sector:
    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/32.png" alt="image32">

    ‚Üí FSInfo signature 0x5256141 ‚Üí RRaA

    ‚Üí Second Signature 0x7x724161 ‚Üí rrAa

    ‚Üí No of free cluster 0x155C0100 ‚Üí 89109

    ‚Üí Next free cluster 0xED230000 ‚Üí 9197

    The number of free clusters found was 0x155C0100 is a **little endian** value, which means we need to translate the value which we get 0x00015C15. And if we translate that value in decimal we get 89109 of free clusters.

    But how many free bytes we have? As we study we need to multiply with 512, but it‚Äôs invalid. We need to check first, how many sectors per cluster.

    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/33.png" alt="image33">

    So we need first need to multiply the number 89109 with 2, which refers to the number of free sectors. Further we will calculate the total number of bytes, which will be `91,247,616 bytes`.

    <img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/34.png" alt="image34">

    <ins>Boot Strap & Reserved Sectors:</ins>

    We don‚Äôt need to know much more about Bootstrap sector, as it has nothing useful. But the sector does end with the end of the sector signature 0x55AA.

    And after that, there comes a reserved sector which are usually all zero.

### <ins>FAT (File Allocation Table) Area:</ins>

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/35.png" alt="image35">

File systems are divided into clusters and FAT acts as map to these clusters. The length of each entry in map depends on the type of FAT file system used.

We already mentioned that, FAT12 have 12 bits, FAT16 have 16 bits and FAT32 would have 28 bits, as the top 4 bits are reserved.

Let‚Äôs explore the the FAT32 system, what each entry actually corresponds:

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/36.png" alt="image36">

Since FAT32 only uses 28 bits and not all 32 bits, that‚Äôs why the top 4 bits in the table entries are represented with the question mark `‚Äú?‚Äù`.

`File could have more than one cluster allocated to it`. For ex: a file has 4 clusters, it means the first entry for this file will have the number of the next cluster in the chain of clusters.

This is why it acts like a linked-list, the first cluster entry points to the next, and the next to the third, and the third to the fourth. The fourth will be holding an end of cluster or end of chain value.

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/37.png" alt="image37">

We read above from boot sector that the first cluster is #2. The main reason is ; the cluster #0 and #1 are both reserved.

**Cluster#0:** is the first byte that holds the `media descriptor` and the other three bytes are all ones (1s). So, if we have a hard disk drive, we will find 0xF8FFFFFF.

**Cluster#1:** is used for dirty volume management. This cluster will store the status of the volume and whether it was mounted and unmounted properly. For eg: If the OS shutdown and didn‚Äôt unmount the volume properly, then this cluster will have value indicating for the system at next boot with that volume as in a **dirty state.** This could help to call the scan or check disk utility to recover the volume and restore its integrity.

As FAT32 uses two FATs (FAT#1 and FAT#2). The high-level view of the entries:

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/38.png" alt="image38">

**How to locate the FAT within the volume?**

**Finding FAT#1:**

‚Üí GoTo the boot sector

‚Üí Check the value in the ‚ÄúReserved No. of sectors‚Äù section.

‚Üí GoTo that sector value found in (2), which will be FAT#1.

**Finding FAT#2:**

‚Üí GoTo boot sector

‚Üí Check the value in ‚ÄúReserved No of sectors‚Äù section

‚Üí Check the value in ‚ÄúSectors per FAT‚Äù section.

‚Üí Adding value found in (2) with value found in (3) leads to location of FAT#2

(Another Method):

‚Üí GoTo FAT#1 and add (3) to it.

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/39.png" alt="image39">


### <ins>FAT Data Area:</ins>

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/40.png" alt="image40">

The structure we read, is about the System Area, now the remaining space is called the Data Area.

The FAT DATA area contains the **meat** of the files stored in the  file system, which means this area hold the file‚Äôs and directories content.

**Here, we found the contents of the files, while directories are special files that hold the file names and metadata of those files.** File names use the **8.3** naming convention, where **eight** characters for the name, and **three** for the file extension.

*Understanding the directories and their metadata, is an important part of any digital forensics investigator, that will be doing forensics on a FAT file system.*

*FAT12/16 has **fixed size section** named the **Root Directory Area**, and that was the limitation on number of files created.*

But with FAT32 file system, there is no such limitation and the only limitation is the size of the volume itself. So, as long as there is space there could be directory entries created.

We can reach the location of **Data Area** by jumping the number of reserved sectors, plus two times the sectors reserved for each FAT.

`Data Area Location = Reserved Sectors + FAT#1 + FAT#2`

The **Root Directory** of the file system is located in cluster#2 and, if the volume had label for it, then the first entry in the directory will be for the label of the volume. The label will be maximum 11 characters long. Root directory sometimes called as **Root** only.

Within FAT32 file system, there are two types of directory entries:

‚Üí  Short File Name (SFN)

‚Üí  Long File Name (LFN)

<ins>Short File Name (SFN) Data Structure:</ins>

The structure for SFN Directory entry found in FAT32 file system:
<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/41.png" alt="image41">
<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/42.png" alt="image42">

<ins>Date Format:</ins>

Let‚Äôs explore how the Date entries (2-bytes) used to store the date since 1980 up to 2107

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/43.png" alt="image43">
Above written **bytes** must be changed to **bits** (Size f*or Date = 2 bytes = 16 bits in total).* 

For example, the date *September 10, 2017* is represented as:
<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/44.png" alt="image44">

This means:

‚Üí  Year (0100101) = 37 + 1980 = **2017**

‚Üí  Month (1001) = 9

‚Üí  Day (01010)= 10

<ins>Time Format:</ins>

Also, time format uses 2 bytes (16 bits) for storing time:
<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/45.png" alt="image45">

For example: time 09:10:55 AM is represented as:

‚Üí Hour (1001) = 9AM

‚Üí Minutes(1010)= 10

‚Üí Seconds (11011) = 55 (Understand 11011 ‚â† 55 but still taking that value, why???)

*It is because, 55/2 = 27.5 as the system is only using 0-29 seconds, so we are assuming 27* )

*We noticed that SFN has naming limitation (above FAT12/16 have naming limitation of Root directory); it can only store files with names; that follow 8.3 naming convention which means the file names could not have a name longer than 8 characters.*

To handle that new structure, LFN (Long File Name) structure was introduced with a file name support up-to 255 chars. Also, chars will be in Unicode and not ASCII, *so they will use 2 bytes to represent each character.*

Whenever there is a file name longer than 8 characters the file system will create a LFN. *Note that, there might be more than one LFN entry for a single file, because the LFN structure can only hold 13 characters for the name.*

**Therefore, the system will create an entry for each 13 character of the file name.**

Let‚Äôs take an example for a file name: eLearnSecurity DFP course.doc which has 25 chars (including the spaces) as it is allowed within LFN entry. This will create following:

‚Üí SFN Entry

‚Üí LFN Entry #1 holding **eLearnSecurit**

‚Üí LFN Entry #2 holding **y DFP Course.**

‚Üí LFN Entry #3 **doc**

<img class="zoomable" src="/assets/notes_image/forensics/file_system/46.png" alt="image46">

The file naming is stored from upwards as in fig. The last LFN has FF to pad the bytes used for the file name.

Although a LFN is created, it also have SFN entry. The SFN will actually have the first 6 characters of the file name, and the **‚Äú~‚Äù** char, then a `number`.

The LFN entries are **synced** with the SFN using the checksum value. This value is 1 byte in length, and calculated based on the chars in the SFN.

The number after **‚Äú~‚Äù** depends on the number of times a file has the same first `6` characters and is found within the same dir. This will hold upto `4 files`, and after that it will use different formula.

For example: Suppose we have another file name eLearnSecurity DFPv2.doc in same directory as our previous file, then the first file created will have a SFN with the name showing **ELEARN~1.doc** also the new created file will have the name as **ELEARN~2.doc**

*Note: Despite file having upper and lower case chars, there will be a LFN created!*

1. Seq. No: It is used to track the LFN entry count. The first LFN will have the number 0x01, the second 0x02 and so on. The final sequence number will be 0x40 ORed with the sequence number. So if we have three LFN entries for a file, the final LFN entry will have the 0x43 value as its sequence number.
2. Name: The name is divided into three different locations:

    ‚Üí  Offset 1: Name chars from 1 to to 5

    ‚Üí  Offset 14: Name chars from 6 to 11

    ‚Üí  Offset 28: Name chars from 12 to 13
    
    *Note: Offset values are shown in decimal*
    
3. Attributes: Single byte is used to define a set of flags (A)rchive, (D)irectory, (V)olume name, (H)idden file, (S)ystem file, (R)ead-only

    *Note: There will be only one entry in volume with V attribute set.*

    ‚Üí **Reserved**: There are two reserved location, the first is at the offset 12, and the second is at 26. Both the entries are reserved and always holds the value 0x00 and 0x0000 respectively.

    ‚Üí **Checksum**: It holds the checksum calculated for the 8.3 name found in the SFN of the file entry. It will be used for synchronization with all LFN entries as mentioned earlier.

    ‚Üí **Subdirectory Structures**: They have same structure as we saw before, only that there are two special entries in any subdirectory:
    
    `Entry #1 is the **‚Äú.‚Äù** or Dot. It is actually a pointer to a same directory`
    `Entry #2 is the ‚Äú..‚Äù or Double Dot. It actually points to the parent directory (one-level up in the file system tree).`
        
    Subdirectories will have their directory attribute set and they will always have a file size of zero, even if the subdirectory has files within it. Also, subdirectories also have date and time sections, just like any other file/directory in the file system.
        
    ‚Üí **File Allocation**: We need to know what will happen and how file will allocated a space when it is created. Let‚Äôs create a file name **Pic.jpg** inside a **Test** directory. The **Test** directory is directly under the root of the file system. It can be viewed as:
